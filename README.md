# CIS-330-File-I-O
This program takes in three text file names as input. 
The first two files contain N integers (where N >=0 and N <= 1,000,000)
whose values range from 0 to 4294967295 (i.e., 32-bit unsigned integers).
The last file is the output file that this program should generate.
For all three files, there should be one integer per line.

For each line in the two input files, the program reads in the two integers, adds them, and then stores the sum in the output file. The program repeats this process until all integers have been read from the input files.
